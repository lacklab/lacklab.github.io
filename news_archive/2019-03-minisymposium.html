The meeting was full of exciting developments and excellent science. It couldn’t have happened without the support of the Newton Advanced Fellowships. This grant has been essential in cementing these productive collaborations with the Opperman and Kawamura groups. Thank you Royal Society!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/em1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/em1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/em1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/em1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 mx-auto d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" " loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/em2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/em2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/em2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/em2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 mx-auto d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" " loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/em3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/em3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/em3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/em3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 mx-auto d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" " loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </body></html>

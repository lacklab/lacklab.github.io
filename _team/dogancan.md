<p>
In 2015, I earned my Genetics and Bioengineering degree from Istanbul Bilgi University. Before that, I spent the summer of 2014 at the Marine Biological Laboratory conducting research on microbial ecology. I then became a PhD student at Lack Lab in April 2016, where I received my doctoral degree in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering in December 2021. Now, I work as a postdoctoral researcher for both Lack Lab and Collins Lab at the Vancouver Prostate Centre. My main focus is understanding the genome organization of prostate cancer and how AR-driven transcription works. To do this, I use a combination of 3C-based technologies and large CRISPR screens.

I am currently completing a Honours BSc in Biochemistry and Forensic Science at the University of British Columbia. I joined the Lack Laboratory in January 2024 as a co-op student to investigate the influence of co-regulatory proteins on androgen receptor (AR) binding and transcriptional activity. This research experience led me to pursue an honours thesis with the lab to deepen my knowledge of gene regulation and cancer biology.
Prior to this role, I completed a co-op term at Virogin Biotech, where I contributed to projects aimed at developing novel oncolytic immunotherapies. In my spare time I enjoy baking, adding to my plant collection and exploring new cafes/restaurants around the Vancouver area!

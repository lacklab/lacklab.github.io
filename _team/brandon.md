<p>
I graduated from UC Irvine with a B.S. in Mathematics, where my studies sparked interests in computer science, machine learning, and eventually the natural sciences. Since joining Lack Lab in Fall 2023, I've applied my quantitative background to deep learning models for protein-DNA binding prediction and am currently exploring computational modeling of gene expression using graph neural networks and E-P networks. Outside the lab, I'm a competitive mixed martial artist and self-proclaimed adventurer.

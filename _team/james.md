I am currently enrolled in the University of British Columbia pursuing my BSc in Honours Biochemistry. Before joining the Lack Lab as a co-op student, I studied the interplay of microtubule assembly during mitosis and its dysregulation specifically in the context of breast cancer. Specifically, how the microtubule-binding protein HMMR plays a role in asymmetric cell division. For my next co-op term, I joined the Lack Lab in January 2024 and was involved in assessing the DNA-binding affinity of different prostate cancer-associated mutations in the protein HOXB13. Despite my co-op term being over, I am staying here to conduct my Honours thesis, in which I am characterizing the binding between HOXB13 and MEIS1 via structural analysis. In my free time, I try to learn to play the drums and enjoy the warm confines of my bed :)

I am currently a fourth year science student majoring in Biochemistry and completing a minor in Microbiology and Immunology at the University of British Columbia. I joined the Lack Lab in January 2025, and I will be investigating the enhancer activity of ARv7 in different cellular contexts. Previously, I completed a co-op placement at Aurora Cannabis where I worked on a cannabis breeding program. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cycling, and playing baseball.

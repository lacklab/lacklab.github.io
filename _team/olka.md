I completed my B.Sc. degree at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to pursue various internships in the field of molecular biology. For my final project, I focused on the identification of novel MLL1 inhibitors for the treatment of colorectal cancer. I then did my master's thesis at DZNE in Bonn, Germany. In my thesis, I conducted an evaluation of the expression of EIF3 subunits and ribosomal proteins in microglia during aging in both wild-type and APP/PS1 mouse models. Additionally, I assessed the effect of Tomivosertib on EIF4E phosphorylation. In December 2023, I joined the Lack Laboratory at the Vancouver Prostate Center as a Ph.D. student. In my spare time, I enjoy immersing myself in literature. I also find joy in playing the Setar and learning new languages.

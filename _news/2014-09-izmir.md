Several members of the Lack Lab had the opportunity to present at the 3rd International Congress of the Molecular Biology Association of Turkey in Izmir. I'd like to congratulate all of them on their excellent presentations. We did however receive word from the organizers that Ugur will be banned from future conferences due to his excessive public displays of scientific affection.

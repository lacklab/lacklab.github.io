In collaboration with Tugba and Tamer Onder we were delighted to bring several leading scientists from the University of Oxford for a Chemical Epigenetic Minisymposium at Koç University. The meeting was full of exciting developments and excellent science. It couldn’t have happened without the support of the Newton Advanced Fellowships. This grant has been essential in cementing these productive collaborations with the Opperman and Kawamura groups. Thank you Royal Society!
